# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this study,two csv documents are merged and analyzed. First document, ![city_data.csv](./Resources/city_data.csv), contains name of 120 cities, the number of drivers of each city and the type (urban, suburban and rural) of each city. Second document, ![ride_data.csv](./Resources/ride_data.csv), contains name of cities, date, fare in each date and ride_id.

In the work, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type is created. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares, within the dates 01/01/2019 and 04/28/2019, for each city type is created. 

Finally, based on the findings in the work a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer is prepared and presented.

### Purpose

The purpuse of the analysis is to find out how data concerning fare differs by city type and how to use these findings to make decision.

## Results of Analysis and Essential Points of the Code





### Analysis of Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare Per Driver for Each Type of City



### Analysis of the Total Weekly Fares for Each Type of City
